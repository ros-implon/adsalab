Question 1: Stacks: Compartment Rearrangement Problem
-----

Given positive Integer n, and a sequence A consisting of n numbers ranging from 1 to n, write a program to find whether A can be obtained from the original sequence (1, 2, ..., n) or not, print 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.

**Input**

The first line contains a number n, which is the number of compartments.
Each subsequent line contains n integers which is a permutation of 1 to n.

Each block ends with 0, print blank line after each block ends. If there are two consecutive 0s, end the program

**Output**

Print 'Yes' if rearrangement is possible else print 'No'

Question 2: PostfixExpression Evaluation
-----

Given a postfix expression that consists of operators in the set (+, -, X, /), write a program to evaluate the expression and print the result.

**Input**

The first line contains a number t, which is the number of testcases.
Each subsequent line contains a expression with all operators and operands separated by a blank space.

**Output**

Print the value of the expression in a new line
